                HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE:
                There’s no perfect line that you can say, to get the girl. The only
                purpose of your first line is to help you start the conversation with her.
                The best ones are the ones you create on the spot. That’s how I
                created most of mine.
                Be free to come up with your own things to say. That should be the
                goal. Use these as ‘fake it till you make it.
                ’ Till you have a better
                understanding about talking to girls. After that, you’ll be coming up
                with your own things you can say instantly and everything will from there.

                Pick 2-3 examples form below with which you resonate with the most.
                See the results for yourself.
                Keep using the ones which work.
                As you get better with approaching people, start trying out the more
                risky ones to improve your results and expand your comfort zone.
